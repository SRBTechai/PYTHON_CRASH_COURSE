# # operators in python
# 1) Arithmatic Operators
# 2) Assignment Operators
# 3) Comparison Operators
# 4) Logical Operators
# 5) Membership Operators
# 6) Bitwise Operators

# # ARITHMATIC OPERATORS
# print("5+6 is ",5+6)
# print("5-6 is ",5-6)
# print("5*6 is ",5*6)
# print("5/6 is ",5/6)
# print("5**6 is ",5**6)
# print("5//6 is ",5//6)
# print("5%6 is ",5%6)

# # ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
# x = 5
# print(x)
# x +=7
# print(x)
# x=x+7
# print(x)
# x/=2
# print(x)
# x=x/2
# print(x)

# COMPARISON OPERATORS
# i = 7
# print(i==5)  # False
# print(i==7)  # True
# print(i!=5)  # True
# print(i>=5) # True
# print(i<6) # False

# LOGICAL OPERATORS
# A = True and B = False  it will give you "False"
# A = True or B = False  it will give you "True"
# a= True
# b= False
# print(a and b)  # False
# print(a or b)   # True

# IDENTITY OPERATORS
# print(5 is 5) # True
# print(5 is 10) # False
# print(5 is not 5) # False
# print(5 is not 4) # True

# MEMBERSHIP OPERATORS
# lista = [3,4,5,78,21,3,7]
# print(78 in lista)  # True
# print(6 in lista)  # False
# print(88 not in lista) # True
# print(3 not in lista)  # False

# BITWISE OPERATORS
# O = 00
# 1 = 01
# 2 = 10
# 3 = 11
